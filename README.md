# Baseball-Simulator-in-R

***README IN PROGRESS SEPTEMBER, 2020***
A baseball simulation in R that simulates 9 inning games for a given lineup and analyzes runs scored per game. Analyzes baseball as a Markovian game of discrete events and pulls data from 2018 season retrosheet data to create transition probability matrices.

Simulation code makes many references to existing simulations which are documented within the code and accompanying paper.
