# Baseball-Simulator-in-R

***README IN PROGRESS SEPTEMBER, 2020***
A baseball simulation in R that simulates 9 inning games for a given lineup and analyzes runs scored per game with the goal of studying optimal lineup (i.e. where should the best batter bat?). Analyzes baseball as a Markovian game of discrete events and pulls data from 2018 season retrosheet data to create transition probability matrices. 

I encourage others to make improvements of the code. Current tasks include: 

0) placing functions within package 
1) adding pitcher-batter matchups
2) adding field characteristics
3) more accurate lineup simulation

Simulation code makes many references to existing simulations which are documented within the code and accompanying paper.
