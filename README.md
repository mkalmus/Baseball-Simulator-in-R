# Baseball-Simulator-in-R

***README IN PROGRESS SEPTEMBER, 2020***
A baseball simulation in R that simulates 9 inning games for a given lineup and analyzes runs scored per game with the goal of studying optimal lineup (i.e. where should the best batter bat?). Analyzes baseball as a Markovian game of discrete events and pulls data from 2018 season retrosheet data to create transition probability matrices. 

I encourage others to make improvements and commit to the code, which is provided under the MIT license. This project began as a way for me to learn simulation principles and R and has became something I enjoy learning more about and adding to in my spare time.

Current tasks include: 

1) clearer documentation
1) placing functions within package 
2) adding pitcher-batter matchups
3) adding field characteristics
4) more accurate lineup simulation

Simulation code makes many references to existing simulations which are documented within the code and accompanying paper.
